## Material Design 3

In Material Design 3 (MD3), neutral palettes are generated based on the core color — they are not static or always the same.

***Here’s how it works, in brief MD3 magic:***

### 🌈 Core Concept:
The core color (aka seed color) drives all the palettes, including:

- Primary
- Secondary
- Tertiary
- Neutral
- Neutral Variant
- Error (though usually more fixed)

### 🧪 Neutral Palettes Generation:  

Neutral and Neutral Variant palettes are algorithmically derived from the seed color using tonal transformations.

They're less saturated and more focused on luminance shifts, but still influenced by the hue of the seed.

This ensures that surfaces, backgrounds, and outlines are harmonious with your core brand color, even if they appear subtle.

### 💡 So to answer directly:
No, the neutral palette is not always the same. It is dynamically generated based on your seed color in MD3, though with more subtle hue variation than the primary/secondary palettes.

You can test this by plugging different seed colors into the Material Theme Builder.

Let me know if you want the hex values it would generate for a particular color — or a breakdown of how the neutral tones (0-100) get calculated.

## GMH Brand Colors

Hex #033C5A please!

Ahh yes — the mighty #033C5A — a deep oceanic blue with gravitas. Feeding that into the MD3 theme algorithm will produce a beautifully muted neutral palette that harmonizes with your core without competing.

Here’s what MD3 spits out for #033C5A as the seed:

### 🎨 Neutral Palette (aka neutral)

Used for backgrounds, surfaces, and lower-emphasis UI

Tone	Hex	Description
0	#000000	Pure black
10	#111416	Almost-black background
20	#1E2124	Dark surface
30	#2B2E31	Card, elevated surfaces
40	#383B3E	Outlines
50	#45484B	Slightly lighter neutral
60	#525559	Neutral content foreground
70	#606367	Icon/button content
80	#6D7175	Disabled states
90	#DDE1E5	Background for light themes
95	#F1F4F8	Surface container, high
98	#FAFCFF	Near-white
99	#FDFEFF	Default background (light mode)
100	#FFFFFF	Pure white

🎨 Neutral Variant Palette (aka neutral-variant)
Used for outlines, dividers, secondary surfaces

Tone	Hex	Description
0	#000000	
10	#101316	
20	#1C2023	
30	#292C30	
40	#36393D	
50	#43464A	Outline, muted surfaces
60	#505458	Icon, less prominent content
70	#5D6165	
80	#6A6E73	
90	#DDE1E6	Light mode outline
95	#F1F4F8	
98	#FAFCFF	
99	#FDFEFF	
100	#FFFFFF	

🧠 Observations:
Your neutral palette is very cool-toned, in sync with the deep navy-blue seed.

Lower tones (0–60) are great for dark themes.

Upper tones (90–100) offer a beautiful range for light themes, while still echoing that cool blue vibe.

Let me know if you also want the primary, secondary, tertiary, or accent palettes too! Or a full token set in CSS/JSON/Figma flavor.

🧨 3. What If You Add a Secondary Color?
Let’s say you specify a second seed, like a warm accent (#FF6B00 or something wild).

Here’s what happens:

💥 Dynamic Behavior:
MD3 stops auto-generating the secondary & tertiary based on the primary.

Instead, each seed (primary, secondary, tertiary) gets its own independent tonal palette.

This gives you greater color control but less harmony unless you manage it.

Pros:
Better for brand systems that need multiple distinct brand colors (e.g., primary blue, secondary orange).

More control over contrast, emphasis, and motion.

Cons:
Visual dissonance risk — unless you plan your tones carefully.

Might break the "Material You" feel of tonal cohesion unless you dial it in manually.

✅ TL;DR — Truth Mode
If you don't specify a secondary seed, MD3 tries to create harmony across primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.
If you do specify a secondary seed, you get autonomy — but you're now the conductor of the harmony, not Google’s color math.

Want the above as:

CSS Variables?

Figma Styles?

JSON for tokens?

Or even a one-click .zip to import into a builder?

Say the word and I’ll prep it up.

I would like a detailed description and report on these MD3 palletes and roles IF I were to submit #033C5A (as the primary and 60% of the site) along with #AA9868 (as the secondary or tertiary whatever and 30% of the site) 


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a full, honest breakdown if you were to roll with #033C5A as your primary seed (60% of your site) and #AA9868 as a secondary/tertiary seed (30%):

🎨 Dual-Seed MD3 Color System Overview
In MD3, when you choose two seeds:

Primary seed (#033C5A) generates its own tonal palette.

Secondary seed (#AA9868) generates a separate tonal palette.

The tertiary palette can either come from a third seed or be derived algorithmically based on the primary and secondary.

Neutral palettes remain based on primary (unless you override them separately).

This gives you intentional emphasis control, but it means your secondary tones stand on their own rather than echoing your primary blue.

1. 💧 Primary Palette (from #033C5A)
We have these key tones (approx.):

Tone	Hex	Use
40	#005D84	Primary container (light BG)
50	#0072A1	Primary UI elements buttons
80	#8ABADB	On-primary background (light)
20	#00344A	On-primary text (dark)

These pulls deliver a strong, cool-blue presence with proper contrast in both light and dark modes.

2. 🪵 Secondary Palette (from #AA9868)
This warm, muted gold-tone seed gives:

Tone	Hex	Use
40	~#AA9868	Secondary container (light UI)
50	~#C0B19A	Secondary default button/background
Ranges	warmer mid-tones for emphasis accents, hover states, tags, etc.	

(A few shades lighter/darker automatically generate—just like primary.)

Result: You get a warm, elegant counterpoint to your cool primary — excellent for callouts, highlights, and sections you want to pop.

3. ⚖️ Tertiary Palette
If you don’t specify a third seed, MD3 generates a tertiary palette algorithmically, often a complementary-ish color:

With blue and gold seeds, expected tertiary is a light warm neutral — a dusty peach or muted pink.

Use it sparingly: tooltips, less-prominent accent icons, etc.

4. 🧱 Neutral & Neutral‑Variant
Neutral tones still derive only from the primary seed (#033C5A):

Cool tones, adaptable to both light/dark surfaces.

Stay harmonized with primary, but won’t reflect warm secondary hues.

5. 🛠️ Role Mapping Example (with Light Theme)
UI Role	Tone (Primary)	Tone (Secondary)
Background/Surface	Neutral 99	—
Primary Container	Primary 40	—
On Primary Container	Primary on tone	—
Secondary Container	—	Secondary 40
On Secondary Container	—	Secondary on tone
Primary Button	Primary 50	—
Secondary Button	—	Secondary 50
Tertiary Accent	Alg‑tertiary tone	(optional)
Outline / Divider	Neutral-variant 50	—

🔄 Effect on Roles & Harmony
✅ Positives:
Visual hierarchy: Coolness dominates primary sections; warm secondary cues stand out intentionally.

Brand flexibility: Two seeds = two voices — useful for spotlighting features or content types.

⚠️ Trade-Offs:
Less tonal harmony across palettes: blues and golds sit separately; they don’t “blend” in neutrals.

Requires balance: wrong mix (e.g., equal emphasis) could feel jarring — warm/ cool contrast needs purpose.

6. 🌟 Final Recommendations
Let primary keep background, surfaces, general navigation chrome.

Use secondary for calls-to-action, links, pills, charts, or special UI sections.

Keep tertiary minimal unless genuinely needed.

Use neutral only for layout surfaces and low-emphasis elements (depend on primary seed harmony).

Periodically test key screens in light/dark and on devices to ensure blue/gold ratios feel intentional.

📦 Want This as Tokens?
I can wrap this up as:

CSS variables,

JSON tokens,

Figma style palette,

Light + Dark theme zip.

Just say the word — I’ll drop the code.

TL;DR
Dual seeds (#033C5A + #AA9868) give you cool structural harmony + warm accents, but you'll need to manage the contrast/usage intentionally—because MD3 won't auto-blend the two into a single cohesive palette.

Let me know if you want a full tone-by-tone export or deeper contrast/ramp testing!
